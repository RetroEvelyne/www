  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>A previous post talked about my then recently purchased Thinkpad X200, and
whilst I love that machine and still continue to use it, it definitely has its
problems. For example the battery life was just not up to par with my lifestyle.
Especially how it has transformed with University. The Thinkpad just isn&rsquo;t able
to keep up with a 7-8 hour day without needing multiple charges, which would be
extremely limiting.
For this reason and others as well, I decided that I needed a new laptop. Now, my
budget was very good, on the order of a couple thousand pounds, therefore I was not
limited in my choice set. I had a few simple requirements that helped narrow down
the options:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can not run Windows or ChromeOS. I have not ran windows in some years now and
I am not willing to start again here.</li>
<li>It had to have at least 8 hours of continual use in it without charging. It
is not a good quality of mine that I often forget to charge my devices but I
could make the choice to make my life easier with a better battery life.</li>
<li>It had to be powerful. One of the downsides to the Thinkpad is the speed, not
being able to comfortably run a browser in a graphical environment would make
University a much worse experience.</li>
<li>It must be cool. There&rsquo;s no worse laptop for University in my opinion than a
&ldquo;gaming laptop&rdquo;. The flashy RGB lights, the weird pointy shape and the absolute
size of some of the laptops that I see just turn me off. Laptops, especially work
laptops, are meant to be light and portable. Why would I carry a gaming pc cosplayed
as a laptop around my University.</li>
<li>It must last long. I am not okay with the idea of replacing my laptop every year.
The laptop must reasonably last until the end of University.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these reasons, I only really faced two options, either a framework laptop loaded
with Linux, or a Macbook. What made me decide was the power and the battery, due to
linux on laptops not being all the way there yet, the power efficiency of the Macbook
became one of the key selling points for me. Also the price to power of the
Macbook made much more sense to me. After lots (and I mean lots) of mulling this
decision over, I eventually decided to get a 13&quot; M3 Macbook Air.</p>
<p>Unluckily for me, I got it just a few months before the 16Gb RAM base model upgrade,
meaning that I paid extra to get 16Gb of RAM. Aside from that I got the 512Gb SSD
storage, which has been more than plenty. Along with the 10 core GPU, I was set.
Now I could have gotten the M2 for considerably cheaper, however due to this machine
both needing to last a few years and being my main machine for any University programming,
I decided to go for the M3.</p>
