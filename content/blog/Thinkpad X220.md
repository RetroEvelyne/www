My Lenovo Thinkpad X220 is, in my opinion at least, one of the best laptops out there. Unless you
really need the extra oomph in performance, you shouldn't pay sky high prices for these top of the
line laptops out there. I got my Thinkpad off of ebay for £209.99, the base price was £179.99 but I
shilled out an extra £30 for a RAM and an SSD upgrade (120Gb --> 240Gb, 4Gb --> 8Gb). Another thing
I should mention is that it did come pre-librebooted.

# The battery
I'll just give it to you straight, the battery life on my Thinkpad X220 is shit. Even with minimal
usage, I still run through multiple charges a day. For many people, including me, this is an issue.
Luckily in most of my lessons at College I have access to a socket that I can charge from whilst
working, this is a different case during independent study however, most of the time I'm having to
keep a watchful eye on my battery life as to not run out of charge without having saved all my work.
However, this is not a deal breaker for me. The Thinkpad X220 has a removable battery which means
eventually I will invest in a spare battery for these situations where I cannot charge for a large
period of time.

# Performance
Maybe I set my expectations low but honestly the performance from the X220 has been largely perfect.
It does everything I need it to do

I hate this blo0gsies
