# About

Hi, my name's Evelyne but I go as RetroEvelyne on the interwebs. I am a British student that currently studies Further Maths, Computer Science, and Psychology for my A levels


## Gender/Sexuality
I identify as [genderfluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_fluidity), which for me basically just means that sometimes I feel more girly or boyish. My friends use they/she pronouns but I am really ok with any pronouns (and in certain situations prefer others).

I also use the term [bisexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality) to describe my sexuality, but in reality its a bit of a copout because I can't be bothered to find a proper term. I feel like I could feel romantic and sexual attraction to any gender, how they identify has almost no effect on my feelings as other factors are way more important to me.

## Hobbies
I enjoy many hobbies such as:

- **Fountain pens**

Inevitably, being a student, I write a lot. So why should my writing experience be sub-par? It only makes sense that I try to use the best stationary that I can. For that reason I use fountain pens almost exclusively and it has become a hobby of mine.

- **Ichthyology**

Ichthyology is the study of fish, and for me is mainly the study of chondrichthyes (sharks, skates, rays, chimaeras, etc). Sharks are my favourite animals as they are so diverse and interesting. I don't claim to know a lot about fish but it is certainly an interest of mine.

- **Philosophy / Psychology / Politics**

Disclaimer: I am in no possible way a philosopher or a psychologist or a politician. I just enjoy thinking deeply about things and I like the advice for life that it gives me. Different ways of thinking are very interesting to me.

- **Technology**

Come on be honest, would I have a personal website if I wasn't at least interested in technology. There are lots of very niche areas of technology/computing that are very worth looking at. In my opinion, we are inevitably heading towards a technology run world, and therefore there is no excuse to be computer illiterate.
