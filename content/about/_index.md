# About

I am a British student that currently studies Computer Science 
at university.


## Hobbies
I enjoy many hobbies such as:

- **Fountain pens**

Inevitably, being a student, I write a lot. So why should my writing experience be sub-par? It only makes sense that I try to use the best stationary that I can. For that reason I use fountain pens almost exclusively and it has become a hobby of mine.

- **Ichthyology**

Ichthyology is the study of fish, and for me is mainly the study of chondrichthyes (sharks, skates, rays, chimaeras, etc). Sharks are my favourite animals as they are so diverse and interesting. I don't claim to know a lot about fish but it is certainly an interest of mine.

- **Philosophy / Psychology / Politics**

Disclaimer: I am in no possible way a philosopher or a psychologist or a politician. I just enjoy thinking deeply about things and I like the advice for life that it gives me. Different ways of thinking are very interesting to me.

- **Technology**

Come on be honest, would I have a personal website if I wasn't at least interested in technology. There are lots of very niche 
areas of technology/computing that are very worth looking at. In my opinion, we are inevitably heading towards a technology run 
world, and therefore there is no excuse to be computer illiterate.
